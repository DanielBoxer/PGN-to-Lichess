Easily open PGNs in Lichess by selecting text and using the context menu. The PGN will be opened in a new tab.

You can use this on any PGN, for example on Chess.com if you want to analyse your game for free.

This add-on can also open your Chess.com games in Lichess without having to select any text by pressing the `Chess.com to Lichess` button.
